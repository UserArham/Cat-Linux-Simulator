# Cat Linux

Cat Linux is a browser-based operating system simulation inspired by
classic 32-bit Linux environments. The system boots from a command-line
interface, runs an initial setup process, and loads a graphical homescreen
containing 25 clickable applications.

This project is designed for educational and demonstration purposes and
focuses on structure, flow, and system-style interaction rather than
actual kernel-level functionality.

## Core Concepts

- Command-based startup (`Start`)
- Boot and setup sequence
- 32-bit iconic visual style
- Desktop-style application launcher
- Modular architecture prior to single-file consolidation

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- SCSS / SASS
- JavaScript
- Python (logic reference only)
- MIT License

## Startup Flow

1. User enters the command `Start`
2. System boot screen is displayed
3. Initial setup process runs
4. Graphical homescreen loads
5. User can open applications from the desktop

## Applications

- 25 applications are available on the homescreen
- Applications are clickable
- All applications open within a windowed interface
- Application logic is centralized and modular

## Project Structure

The project is intentionally split into multiple files and directories
to demonstrate proper separation of concerns.  
In a later phase, all assets will be combined into a single `index.html`.

## Notes

- Cat Linux is a simulation, not an actual Linux operating system
- Python is included for reference and structural logic only
- Visual design is inspired by classic 32-bit systems
